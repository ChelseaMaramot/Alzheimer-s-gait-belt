# Alzheimer-s-gait-belt
Alzheimer's gait belt detects and monitors unusual gait changes of a patient  in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
This uses a BNO055 absolute orientation sensor, as well as a Raspberry Pi, in order to monitor, detect, and alert the user of any unsual changes to their gait.
These changes can include changes in user's walking speed and the lurching.
